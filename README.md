# Neuroevolution for Controlling Spacecraft

This project was submitted as coursework for the Computational Intelligence module at Napier University which required the weights for an artificial neural network to be evolved using an evolutionary algorithm. The neural network is used to guide a spacecraft to land safely.

Details of the approach taken and the implementation can be found in the report pdf.
